            <p>
              Hi I'm Faizan a self taught, full-stack JavaScript developer with
              a passion for motion design. My favorite development stack at the
              moment is React, Material Design, Node and MongoDB. Values I hold
              high are loyalty, reliability, authenticity and helping other
              achieve their success. Which is why I see projects through to the
              end and why I believe in not only creating beautiful software but
              also reliable and reflect the client's brand and that is easy to
              use so that it does not distract the a user experience
            </p>
            <p>
              Whether itâ€™s creating servers in Node, connecting to MongoDB
              databases or designing unique user experiences per device whilst
              still maintaining a consistent brand experience I will bring your
              ideas to life.
            </p>
